# NetEvolve.FluentValue

This is a simple library that allows you to validate the given value against a set of constraints. It is designed to be used in a fluent way, so you can chain multiple constraints together. Most of the constraints have multipe execution paths, so that based on the value, delivers the most fitting result.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package NetEvolve.FluentValue
```
